#  Minishell

**Minishell** is a basic Unix-like shell written in C. It supports core shell features including basic command execution, input/output redirection, pipelines, and a simple prompt loop. This project is designed as a learning tool to understand how shells work under the hood.

---

##  Features

- Basic command execution (`ls`, `pwd`, `date`, etc.)
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`
- Input redirection (`<`)
- Output redirection (`>` and `>>`)
- Command piping (`|`)
- Simple prompt loop with graceful termination

---

##  Installation

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreadline-dev
```

---

##  Compilation

You can compile the project in two ways:

### ðŸ”¸ Using GCC directly:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror main.c builtins.c parser.c executor.c suggest.c custom.c  -o minishell -lreadline -lncurses
```

### ðŸ”¸ Using the Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This will produce an executable called `minishell`.

To clean up compiled objects and binaries:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the shell using:

```bash
./minishell
```

Example commands you can try:

```bash
ls -l | grep ".c" > files.txt
cat < files.txt
cd ..
pwd
exit
```
