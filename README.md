# Minishell

**Minishell** is a modern, educational Unix-like shell written in C, featuring both a classic terminal interface and a beautiful GTK-based GUI. It supports core shell features, custom commands, and a visually appealing, user-friendly experience.

---

## Features

- Basic command execution (`ls`, `pwd`, `date`, etc.)
- Built-in commands: `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`, `echo`
- Input redirection (`<`)
- Output redirection (`>` and `>>`)
- Command piping (`|`)
- Custom commands: `greet`, `clr`, `calculator`, `quit`, `sysinfo`, `findfile`, `createfile`, `help`
- Command suggestions for mistyped commands
- Modern GTK GUI with:
  - Terminal-like prompt, input, and output
  - Command history navigation (up/down)
  - Colored prompt, output, and errors
  - Custom header bar with minimize, maximize, and close buttons
  - Dark theme, monospaced font, and vibrant colors
  - Prompt is un-erasable and always visible
  - GUI-specific features (e.g., calculator dialog)

## Installation

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreadline-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

---

## Compilation

You can compile the project in two ways:

### ðŸ”¸ Terminal version:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror main.c builtins.c parser.c executor.c suggest.c custom.c  -o minishell -lreadline -lncurses
```

### ðŸ”¸ GUI version (GTK):

```bash
gcc -o gui gui.c shell_interface.c shell_core.c builtins.c custom.c executor.c parser.c suggest.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
```

### ðŸ”¸ Using the Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This will produce both `minishell` (terminal) and `gui` (GTK GUI) executables.

To clean up compiled objects and binaries:

```bash
make clean
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Terminal version:
```bash
./minishell
```

### GUI version:
```bash
./gui
```

**GUI Features:**
- Modern, resizable window with custom header bar
- Prompt and output styled like a real terminal
- Command history (up/down arrows)
- Colored prompt, output, and errors
- Un-erasable prompt and protected input area
- Minimize, maximize, and close buttons
- Custom commands (e.g., calculator opens a dialog)

**Example commands:**
```bash
ls -l | grep ".c" > files.txt
cat < files.txt
cd ..
pwd
greet
sysinfo
findfile gui.c
createfile test.txt
calculator
exit
```
